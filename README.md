## Project Introduction

This is a GitHub user search application that allows users to search for GitHub users on the homepage and display a list of users. Users can click on a user in the list to enter their detailed information page, showcasing the user's basic information as well as the repositories they have created.

## Architecture Introduction

This project follows the **Clean Architecture** principles and adopts the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to achieve better modularization and separation of concerns. By decoupling different business logic from UI logic, the project is easier to test and maintain.

Hereâ€™s an overview of your project structure, following the style of your example:

## Modules Overview

The project is divided into several modules:

- **:app** - Main Android app module that coordinates feature and library modules.
- **:feature:home** - Displays a list of GitHub users with the ability to search and store results locally using Room.
- **:feature:details** - Shows detailed information about selected users, including their profile and repositories.
- **:libs:network** - Manages network requests using Retrofit and Moshi for data serialization.
- **:libs:common** - Kotlin-only module providing utility functions and common classes used throughout the app.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technology stack:

- **Clean Architecture**: Implements clean architecture for better separation of concerns, enhancing code maintainability and testability..
- **MVVM**: Implements the MVVM architectural pattern to separate view logic from business logic.
- Flow & ViewModel: For managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Jetpack Compose**: For building the user interface, simplifying the declarative programming approach for UI.
- **Dagger Hilt**: Dagger Hilt simplifies dependency injection across modules and enhances testability by enabling easy mocking for unit and UI tests.
- **Retrofit**: Used for network requests, simplifying the process of API calls.
- **Room Database**: Provides local database support for easy data storage and querying.
- **Moshi**: Used for parsing JSON data, enhancing the efficiency of data serialization and deserialization.
- **Coil**: For image loading, offering smooth image processing and caching functionality.
- **GitHub Authorize**: Uses GitHub OAuth for authorization, ensuring users can safely access and search GitHub data.
